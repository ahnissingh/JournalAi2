# End-to-End Testing Plan for JournalAI

## Introduction

This document outlines the approach for end-to-end testing of the JournalAI application. After implementing unit tests for the user module's controllers, services, and repositories, we need to decide whether to implement end-to-end tests for the user module in isolation or for all modules combined.

## Current Testing Status

We have implemented:
- Unit tests for user module services
- Unit tests for user module repositories
- Unit tests for user module controllers

## End-to-End Testing Approach

### Option 1: Module-by-Module End-to-End Testing

**Pros:**
- Easier to set up and maintain
- Faster test execution
- Clearer test failures (easier to identify which module has issues)
- Can be implemented incrementally as each module is completed
- Allows for more focused testing of specific module functionality

**Cons:**
- May miss integration issues between modules
- Requires mocking of dependencies from other modules
- Less representative of real user flows that span multiple modules

### Option 2: Combined End-to-End Testing for All Modules

**Pros:**
- Tests real user flows across module boundaries
- Catches integration issues between modules
- More representative of actual user experience
- Better validation of the entire system

**Cons:**
- More complex to set up and maintain
- Slower test execution
- Test failures may be harder to diagnose
- Requires all modules to be completed before testing can begin
- May be brittle due to the large number of components involved

## Recommendation

**We recommend a hybrid approach:**

1. **Module-Level Integration Tests**: Implement integration tests for each module that test the integration between components within that module (controllers, services, repositories).

2. **Critical Path End-to-End Tests**: Implement a smaller set of end-to-end tests that cover the most critical user flows across modules.

This approach provides the benefits of both options while minimizing the drawbacks.

## Implementation Plan for User Module

### 1. Module-Level Integration Tests

These tests will validate that the components of the user module work together correctly:

- **User Registration and Authentication Flow**
  - Test user registration
  - Test user login
  - Test password reset flow

- **User Profile Management Flow**
  - Test retrieving user profile
  - Test updating user profile
  - Test updating user preferences

- **Therapist-User Interaction Flow**
  - Test therapist registration
  - Test user subscribing to therapist
  - Test therapist viewing clients

- **Admin Management Flow**
  - Test admin user management (create, update, delete)
  - Test admin enabling/disabling users
  - Test admin locking/unlocking users

### 2. Critical Path End-to-End Tests (to be implemented after all modules)

These tests will validate critical user flows that span multiple modules:

- **Journal Entry and Analysis Flow**
  - User logs in
  - User creates a journal entry
  - System analyzes the journal entry
  - User receives analysis report

- **Therapist Feedback Flow**
  - User logs in
  - User subscribes to therapist
  - User creates a journal entry
  - Therapist logs in
  - Therapist views client's journal entry
  - Therapist provides feedback
  - User receives notification
  - User views therapist feedback

- **Notification and Reminder Flow**
  - System sends journal reminder
  - User logs in from reminder
  - User creates a journal entry
  - System sends analysis notification
  - User views analysis

## Tools and Technologies

For end-to-end testing, we recommend:

1. **Selenium WebDriver** or **Playwright** for browser automation
2. **RestAssured** for API testing
3. **TestContainers** for database and service dependencies
4. **Cucumber** for behavior-driven development (BDD) style tests

## Test Environment

End-to-end tests should run in an environment that closely resembles production:

1. Use TestContainers for MongoDB
2. Use TestContainers for Milvus vector database
3. Mock external services (email, OpenAI) for predictable behavior

## Conclusion

By implementing both module-level integration tests and critical path end-to-end tests, we can ensure that:

1. Each module functions correctly in isolation
2. The modules work together correctly for critical user flows
3. The system as a whole provides the expected user experience

This approach balances thoroughness with maintainability and allows for incremental implementation as the system evolves.
