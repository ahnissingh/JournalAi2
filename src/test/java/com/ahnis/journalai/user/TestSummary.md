# User Module Test Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

We have successfully implemented the following tests for the user module:

### Service Layer Tests
- [x] UserServiceImplTest - Tests for the UserServiceImpl class, covering all methods and edge cases.
- [x] AuthServiceImplTest - Tests for the AuthServiceImpl class, covering user registration, login, and therapist registration.
- [x] AdminServiceImplTest - Tests for the AdminServiceImpl class, covering user management functions.
- [x] TherapistServiceTest - Tests for the TherapistService class, covering therapist-related functionality.
- [x] CustomUserDetailsServiceTest - Tests for the CustomUserDetailsService class, covering user loading and caching.

### Repository Layer Tests
- [x] UserRepositoryTest - Integration tests for the UserRepository interface, covering all custom query methods.
- [x] TherapistRepositoryTest - Integration tests for the TherapistRepository interface, covering all custom query methods.
- [x] PasswordResetTokenRepositoryTest - Integration tests for the PasswordResetTokenRepository interface.

### Scheduler Tests
- [x] JournalingReminderSchedulerTest - Tests for the JournalingReminderScheduler class, covering reminder functionality.

## Test Results

### Service Layer Tests
All service layer tests are passing successfully. These tests use Mockito to mock dependencies and focus on testing the business logic in isolation.

### Repository Layer Tests
The repository tests are currently failing due to issues with the MongoDB testcontainer configuration. This needs to be addressed before moving forward with more repository tests.

### Scheduler Tests
3 out of 4 scheduler tests are passing. The failing test is "Should handle null timezone by not sending reminder" which is failing with a NullPointerException. This indicates that the JournalingReminderScheduler.hasUserNotWrittenJournalToday method is not handling null timezones properly.

## Issues to Fix

1. **Repository Tests Configuration**: The MongoDB testcontainer configuration needs to be fixed to allow the repository tests to run successfully. This might involve updating the MongoTestConfig class or adding additional dependencies.

2. **Null Timezone Handling**: The JournalingReminderScheduler class needs to be updated to handle null timezones properly. This can be done by adding a null check before creating the ZoneId in the hasUserNotWrittenJournalToday method.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Repository Tests**: Update the MongoDB testcontainer configuration to allow the repository tests to run successfully.

2. **Fix Scheduler Tests**: Update the JournalingReminderScheduler class to handle null timezones properly.

3. **Implement Controller Tests**: Create tests for the controller layer as outlined in the TestPlan.md file.

4. **Implement End-to-End Tests**: Create end-to-end tests for complete user flows as outlined in the TestPlan.md file.

5. **Move to Journal Module**: After completing the user module tests, move on to the journal module tests as outlined in the TestPlan.md file.

## Conclusion

We have made significant progress in implementing tests for the user module. The service layer tests are complete and passing, and we have a good foundation for the repository and scheduler tests. The next steps are to fix the issues with the repository and scheduler tests, and then move on to implementing the controller and end-to-end tests.

The TestPlan.md file provides a comprehensive roadmap for the remaining tests to be implemented, not only for the user module but also for the journal, analysis, notification, and chatbot modules.
