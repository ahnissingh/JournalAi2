Workflow
1. User Writes a Journal

    User writes a journal → Journal is saved in the Journal collection.

    Update the User collection:

        Add the journal's date to journalDates (if not already present).

        Recalculate currentStreak and longestStreak.

        Update lastJournalEntryDate.

2. User Deletes a Journal

    User deletes a journal → Journal is removed from the Journal collection.

    Update the User collection:

        Check if the deleted journal was the last one for its date.

        If yes, remove the date from journalDates and recalculate streaks.

3. Daily Reminder Job

    Scheduler runs daily at 7 AM.

    For each user:

        Check if lastJournalEntryDate is today (in the user's timezone).

        If not, send a reminder.

4. Display Streak History

    Fetch the journalDates set from the User collection.

    Display a calendar-like view of the user's journaling history.
